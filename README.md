This is MasterMind remade using python's library PyGame.
There is one main script called game.py where all the main game code runs in the while loop.
I have 4 more scripts, 1 for the buttons on script, 1 for the balls that spawn, another unfinished game help and one where i made the game without OOP to help me before
I could implement it in pygame to make it easier to visualize.

Overview:

This follows the same rules as MasterMind's board game, you can choose 4 colors from an option of 6 different colors. Duplicates are acccepted.
The script will choose 4 random colors and the user will have 8 chances to guess the combo the script chose.
If a color is in the right spot the game will print 1 is in the right spot, same for if 1 or more color is in the scripts combo.

If you guess the combo you win if not you lose.

Making this game I used alot of classes and methods to practice my OOP.
I also have assets that I did not use as the game is not complete, I still wanted to share it since it was a nice base for the game.
